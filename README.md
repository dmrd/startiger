    - App
        - add [special] key release callbacks

    - Rendering
        - integrate R3Scene
        - get scenegraph rendering working
        - do a little test render with motion etc.

    - Logic
        - work on GameObject/GameObjectManager stuff
        - possibly work on GameState/Level stuff

    - Physics
        - get some kind of node-based physics/collision system working?
